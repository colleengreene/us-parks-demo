## About This Site

This site is a demo project to test out the [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets) and the [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh) templates for use in digital collection and digital exhibit projects. This demo project was built by [Colleen Robledo Greene, MLIS](https://www.library.fullerton.edu/about/faculty-staff.html?itemID=4b8e-b66a-d31e238), the Digital Scholarship Librarian at California State University, Fullerton, with metadata hosted via Google Sheets.
